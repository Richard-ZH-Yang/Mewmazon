## About
This project provides a platform for customers and sellers to perform trade. We use advanced quires to help the customer make a more insightful decision and allow sellers to see the analysis for the product they are selling. There is a register and sign in page to start with. On the customer main page, customers could change their password, find a list of available products, find all sellers that sell a particular product by the product name, and find a product name for which their price is the minimum overall product name. On the seller main page, a seller is able to see a list of product that they sell, add a product, delete a product, and see how many products they sell are available and is in process.
