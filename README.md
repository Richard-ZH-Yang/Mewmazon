# Mewmazon
## About
This project provides a platform for customers and sellers to perform trade. We use advanced quires to help the customer make a more insightful decision and allow sellers to see the analysis for the product they are selling. There is a register and sign in page to start with. On the customer main page, customers could change their password, find a list of available products, find all sellers that sell a particular product by the product name, and find a product name for which their price is the minimum over all the product names. On the seller main page, a seller is able to see a list of product that they sell, add a product, delete a product, and see how many products they sell are available and is in process.

### Technology Used
We applied **LAMP** tech stack for this project, with a focus on making queries using PHP and SQL Plus. This project contains basic queries such as join, update, insert, delete, as well as advanced queries such as nested aggregation with group by and having, and division.

## What's Next
We are quite ambitious when planning this project, as from the ER diagram, we want to implement everything related to our e-commerce company -- Mewmazon. Currently, only customers and sellers have most of their functionalities complete. We could enable the purchase and finish the functionalities for the staff side in the future.
